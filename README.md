#[Tinkers' Construct](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct)

Modify all the things, then do it again!   
Melt down any metals you find. 	 
Power the world with spinning wind!

### IMC
Tinkers' Construct supports several IMCs to allow mods to integrate themselves. The [Wiki](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/wiki/IMC) contains a page with further information.
Anything that is not possible via IMC has to be integrated via Code through the API/library package.

(old 1.7.10 IMCs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/bonii-xx/e46f9d9e81e29d796b1b)
