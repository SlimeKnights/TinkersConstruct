Modify all the things, then do it again!   
Melt down any metals you find. 	 
Power the world with spinning wind!

##Development
Install Forge as usual, and setup your IDE as with any other Forge project. Forge Multipart, and CClib must be installed from the  Forge File Server: The DEVELOPMENT version of NEI must be installed to the same directory from [Chicken Bones Site](http://www.chickenbones.craftsaddle.org/Files/New_Versions/links.php). Copy `TCore_dummy.jar` to `forge/mcp/jars/mods/` to enable the Preloader (optional -- only needed when working on the preloader itself)
