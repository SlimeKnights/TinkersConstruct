/*
 * Adds three recipes. The first is a Material Recipe that allows a Diamond to be used to create Bone (Material) parts in the Part Builder with a material value of 3 and a needed value of 5.
 * The `needed` value is how many of the input (in this case Diamonds) are needed to make `1` Material.
 * An example of this being Ingots vs Nuggets. Ingots have a `needed` value of `1` while Nuggets have a `needed` value of `9` (since it takes 9 Nuggets to make 1 Ingot).
 *
 * The second is a recipe allowing lava to be casted to create stone parts
 *
 * The final is a recipe that allows water to be poured on iron tool parts to create a Bone version of that part. The recipe has a cooling temperature of 0Â°C.
 * 
 * You can find valid materialIds by running `/ct dump ticMaterials` in-game.
